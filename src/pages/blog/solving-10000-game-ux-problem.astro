          Solving a 10,000-game UX problem with 83 lines of JavaScript. ♟️👨‍💻
        </h1>
        <p>
          If you play chess on different platforms as much as I do, you probably
          use Chess.com to analyze your games. It's a great tool, but I recently
          ran into a massive UX hurdle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had accumulated over 200 pages of saved analysis (that's roughly
          10,000 games!). I wanted to clear my library to start fresh, but I hit
          a wall: There is no "Select All" or "Delete All" button.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was facing the prospect of manually clicking "Delete" → "Confirm" →
          "Delete" → "Confirm" ten thousand times.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not a UX designer at Chess.com, but I am a developer. So, instead
          of complaining about the UX or waiting for them to fix it, I wrote a
          script to handle it myself.
        </p>
        <p>I built a simple Tampermonkey script that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Identifies all games on the current page.</li>
          <li>✅ Automates the deletion click.</li>
          <li>✅ Auto-confirms the custom "Are you sure?" popups.</li>
          <li>
            ✅ Refreshes the pagination to handle the next batch automatically.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It turned a few hours of boring manual clicking into a 15-minute
          automated background task.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve open-sourced it on GitHub for anyone else facing this specific
          Chess.com UX issue.
