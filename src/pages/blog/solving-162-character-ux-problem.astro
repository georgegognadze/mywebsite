        <h3>
          Solving Upwork's 162-character UX problem with dynamic font scaling. 💬👨‍💻
        </h3>
        <p>
          A little while ago, I built a tool to solve a common frustration on Upwork:
          long reviews get visually cut off after just 162 characters. Even when
          clients leave detailed, glowing feedback, the UI hides the best parts behind a
          "read more" link or dots.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first version fixed this by generating an Upwork-style image for reviews
          up to 1,008 characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          🚀 Today, I’m pushing a major update to solve this completely:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            No more character limits: I wrote a new script that auto-adjusts the font
            size based on text length. The tool now handles reviews of 4,800+ characters
            without cutting a single word.
          </li>
          <li>
            Smart QR Code support: You can now embed your profile link directly into the
            feedback image.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Result?</p>
        <p>
          You can now turn a long text review into a shareable asset that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shows the full story (no truncation)</li>
          <li>Links directly to your hire page via QR</li>
          <li>Retains the authentic "Upwork" look</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
